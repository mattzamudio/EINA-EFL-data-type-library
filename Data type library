 * Here, we have a simple callback that prints the name of a file and the path that
 * contains it:
 * @skip static
 * @until }
 *
 * We can use this callback in the following call:
 * @skipline eina_file_dir_list
 *
 * The above callback was a way to print the files in a directory, but it is not the only
 * way:
 * @until iterator_free
 *
 * Other ways to retreive more than just file names include:
 * @until iterator_free
 * @until iterator_free
 *
 * The above ways of retrieving files from a list may produce the same output, but
 * they have an important difference, eina_file_direct_ls() will @b not call
 * stat. This means that on some systems, it may not have file type
 * information. On the other hand, it may be faster than eina_file_stat_ls().
