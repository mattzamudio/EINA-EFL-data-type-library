# Introduction
This repository is a collection of documents I have edited and written for Englightenment open-source software. Each of these files are small pieces of the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries, or EFL, which powers millions of systems including:
* Samsung Galaxy Wearables
* Samsung Smart TVs (such as the Class Q9F QLED 4K TV)
* Smart Refrigerators (such as the Samsung Family Hub)
* GPS Systems (such as the Coyote)

I've created this repository to easily share my technical writing work with potential employers. Thanks for stopping by!
